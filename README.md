# FaceDetection

When I stated working at Publicis my boss was very excited with Google Vision and as you may know if you develop something colorful you will start with the right foot so in my idle time I coded a script that opens the camera of the notebook, detect the face (I used OpenCV for a first face detection) and if there was presence for some seconds the program starts to send some frames to google and receive the sentiment of the face, then I paste on the face an emoji picture based on the sentiment. All this process was in real time so I had to smartly create sub process that let the showing frame not to stop.

The end of the story is that my boss was very happy and said to me "Good job! now keep working on new solutions" and that's all jeje.
